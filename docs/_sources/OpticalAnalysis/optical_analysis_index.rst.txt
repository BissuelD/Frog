Optical Analysis
==================

In the :ref:`overview page<overview_opt_analysis_page>` is presented a general overview of the scientific quantities refer as 'optical'. A quick description of the code input and functionement is also given. 

The :ref:`optical parameter page<optical_parameter_page>` presents the different input available and there uses to deal with optical analysis. 

In the :ref:`electrostatic emmedding page<electrostatic_embedding_page>` is presented in details how the electrostatic environement is taken into account in |frog|. 

The :ref:`QM box page<qm_box_page>` presents in details how the inside of the QM box is built. 

The :ref:`QM management page<qm_management_page>` presents in details how the submission script are generated and how to deal with thousands of QM calculations. This page contains informations about the |frog| uses but also some general advices. As well as the :ref:`advice for QM page<advices_for_qm_page>` which is a sort of Q&A sections.
