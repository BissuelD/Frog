Installation using pip
-----------------------

.. _installation_using_pip:

|frog| is a Python module which can be installed using pip once the *Frog-version.tar.gz* file is downloaded. For that, use: ::

    $ pip install dist/Frog-1.0.0.tar.gz

or similarly: ::
    
    $ python -m pip install dist/Frog-1.0.0.tar.gz

Local python environment
------------------------
If you want to work with a local package installation, with a specific python version for example, you can use python environment. For instance, to create a python environment with a specific version at the localization 'vfrog', use: ::

    $ virtualenv --python=python3.6.1 --system-site-packages vfrog

Then, to use this python version, write: ::

    $ source vfrog/bin/activate

You can check that you are within the correct environment using 'which': ::
    
    $ which pip
    $ which python
    
Then, install |frog| using this version of pip: ::

    $ pip install dist/Frog-1.0.0.tar.gz

Finally, when you want to run |frog|, you shall initialize this version of python with 'source': ::
    
    $ source vfrog/bin/activate
    
Then, you can run |frog| from the shell: :: 

    $ Frog my_parameter.py

For  environment creation, see also https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-gui ?TODO?

Check the installation
----------------------

You can call |frog| within a python environment using the classical import function: ::
    
    import Frog

And modules: ::

        import Frog.main as main

Note that the function Frog.main.frog_run is the main gate to run |frog|. See the :ref:`get started tutorial<get_started_on_frog_tutorial_page>`.

.. note:: This has been tested on Debian. May work on iOs, probably not work on Windows?

You can run |frog| with the parameter file *my_parameter.py* using in the shell: ::
    
    $ Frog my_parameter.py

If you want more information about the numerical requirement, see :ref:`this page.<numerical_notes_and_requirements_page>`

You can also run Frog using python: ::

    $ python -m Frog my_parameter.py
