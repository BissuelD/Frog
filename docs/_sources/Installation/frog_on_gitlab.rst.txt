Before eveything, one have to ask for an account to Cameleon server at
ILM and ask to Guillaum to be invited to Frog project. Moreover, do not
forget to install git on your computer to use shell command !

First connexion to the project on the server:
---------------------------------------------

::

    $ git clone https://cameleon.univ-lyon1.fr/glebreton/frog.git


-  need to enter you login and password to access cameleon server.

-  create a copy of the project on your computer (in the current path)

::

    $ cd frog


-  move to the file extracted from cameleon to have access to git
   functions

::
    
    $ git checkout beta\_tester



-  move on the *beta\_tester* branch.

   Note : it is recommanded to work on this branch only. *Dev* branch is
   for Guillaume only with his last version of the code and *Master*
   branch will contain the version of the code that we will reveal when
   we will submit an article for exemple.

Modification on files on the server
-----------------------------------

Take care to be in the local git file before using the following code
lines..

::
    
    $ git pull


-  Download the last version of the project on the server

-  Necessary to do this step before any modification to avoid version
   conflicts !

::

    $ git commit -a-m 'mon commentaire'



-  register the modifications made on the computer with a version
   history. The label *mon commentaire* allow to explain the main
   modification made to facilitate the tracking of changes.
   

::

    $ git push


-  upload the correction on the on-line server.

Creation of a file and uploading it on the server
-------------------------------------------------

You have to create your file separately and to put it manually on the
wanted repository. Then, the procedure is quite similar to the
modification of file, you just have to index your file.

::
    $ git pull
    $ git add path/file

-  Begin to indexing the file. This step is necessary before uploading
   it on the server

-  You can check if your file is indexed with $git status -s : if it is
   note, you wil have *??* in front of your file name.

::

    $ git commit -a-m 'mon commentaire'


::

    $ git push


Miscellaneous
-------------

::
    
    $ git status -s

-  short information about the status of your files
