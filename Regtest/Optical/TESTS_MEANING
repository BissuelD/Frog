# test_value_fixed
Optical diagrams with fixed molecular values (no QM calculations). 

# test_qm
Optical diagrams with qm-based molecular values, only QM calculations

# test_value_fixed_qm
Mixed cases of the two previous case: alpha or beta at the qm or fixed value level.
2 cases: alpha QM and beta fixed, alpha fixed and beta QM.

# test_read_frequency
QM calculations for polarizability and hyperpolarizability with 2 frequency. Reading is also tested. 

# test_read_frequency_quadrupole
QM calculaiton for hyperpolarizability with 2 frequency at the quadrupole order. Reading is also tested. 

# test_qm_redo_qm 
QM calculation with GP.redo_QM = 'redo' and GP.pass_first_part = False. 
Here the calculation should NOT continue up to the last part even though a fake QM result is given because it starts from the first part

# test_qm_do_not_redo_qm
QM calculation with GP.redo_QM = 'do_not_redo' and GP.pass_first_part = False. 
Here the calculation should continue up to the last part once a fake QM result given even though it starts from the first part 

# test_where_to_run_qm
Different combinaison of selection for QM calculations. 
1: Given by the Diagram definition: All type 
2: Given by both the Diagram and where_to_run_QM: Plane type 
3: Given by where_to_run_QM: Plane type
4: Given by both the Diagram and where_to_run_QM: Layer type
5: No overlap between Diagram and where_to_run_QM. Should give zero. 
6: Given by where_to_run_QM: Layer type
7: Given by where_to_run_QM and selection_tool: Layer type
