# test1
Every analysis with simple discretization options and parameters 

# test2
Every discretization option with simple diagrams. No special selection

# test3a-f
Every discretization option with simple diagrams. Special selection options 

# test_molecular_orientation
Molecular Orientation parameters. Tested for H2O and methanol in bulk. 

# test_hbonds 
H-bond parameters. Tested for H2O and methanol in bulk.

# test_electric_field
Electric field parameters. Tested for H2O and methanol in bulk.
The first test tries the on_fly command only.
The second test uses also the QM/MM part to compute the electric field. Another run is perform after this one, _next, to check that the electric field has been computed as expected. To do so, we copy fake QM results between the initial and the _next run to perform the third part of Frog run.
